#Math 4640 Numerical Analysis
##Date: 8/17

###What is Numerical Analysis?
**Three great branches of science:**
- Theory
- Experiment
- Computation
- *Data*?

Numerical Analysis is Study of Algroithms for Problems of Continuous Mathematics, *e.x.*
- Newton's method
- Lagrange interpolation polynomial
- Gaussian Elimination, Euler's method...

Computational mathematics is mainly based on:
- Taylor series
- Linear Algebra

**Computer use**
- Most mathematical problems cannot be solved by finite sequence of elemntary operations
- Need: fast algorithms that converge to 'approximate' answers accurate to many digits of precision, in science and engineering applications

###Different Types of Problems in Numerical Computing
**Problem F: can be solved in a finite sequence of elemntary operations:**
- Root for polynomial of degree 4: close form formula exists (Ferrari 1540)
- Solving linear equations
- Linear Programming

**Problem I: Cannot be solved in a finite sequence of elemntary operations:**
- Root for polynomial of degree 5 and higher: no close form formula exists (Ruffini and Abel, around 1800)
- Finding eigenvalues of an *n x n* matrix with *n >= 5*
- Minimize a function of several variables
- Evaluate an integral
- Solve an ODE
- Solve a PDE

Problem F is not necessarily easier than Problem I.  When problem dimension is very high, one often ignores the exact
solution and uses approximate and fast methods instead.

E.x. Googleâ€™s PageRank - eigenvector of a matrix of order in the billions

###Gauss (1777-1855) and Numerical Computing
- Least squares data fitting (1795)
- Systems of linear equations (1809)
- Numerical quadrature (1814)
- Fast Fourier transform (1805) - not well known until it was rediscovered by Cooley and Tukey (1965)

**Numerical Linear Algebra**
- Square linear system solving
- Least squares problems
- Eigenvalue problem

Often, algorithms = Matrix Factorization

###Well-posed/Ill-posed Problems
Problem is well-posed if solution:
- exists
- is unique
- depends continuously on problem data
Otherwise, problem is ill-posed.

Even if problem is well-posed, solution may still be sensitive to input data

Computational algorithm should not make sensitivity worse
